# **🏷️ Project Type** - 
## 📊 Machine Learning | Financial Analytics | Risk Assessment | MLOps | Streamlit Web App

# **📌 Project Summary**

## EMIPredict AI is an end-to-end machine learning platform that predicts EMI eligibility and maximum affordable monthly EMI for customers. It combines classification and regression models, real-time predictions, experiment tracking using MLflow, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard for decision support.

# **❗ Problem Statement**

## Financial institutions face challenges in accurately assessing a customer’s EMI eligibility while minimizing default risk.
## Manual evaluation is time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent.
## This project automates EMI risk assessment using data-driven machine learning models.

# **🎯 Objectives**

* ### Predict whether a customer is Eligible / Not Eligible / High Risk

* ### Estimate the maximum affordable monthly EMI

* ### Track and compare model performance using MLflow

* ### Provide a user-friendly web application for real-time predictions

# **🗂️ Dataset Description**

## 📄 The dataset contains customer financial and demographic attributes such as:

* ### Age, gender, education, marital status

* ### Monthly salary and employment details

* ### Credit score, existing loans, bank balance

* ### Monthly expenses and requested loan details

# **📊 Targets:**

* ### ***emi_eligibility → Classification***

* ### ***max_monthly_emi → Regression***

# **🧪 Machine Learning Models Used**
## 🔹 Classification Models :-

* ### Logistic Regression

* ### Random Forest Classifier

* ### XGBoost Classifier

## 🔹 Regression Models

* ### Linear Regression

* ### Random Forest Regressor

* ### XGBoost Regressor

### ✔️ Best models selected based on F1-Score (classification) and RMSE (regression).

# **🧰 Libraries & Tools Used**

* ### 🐍 Python

* ### 📊 Pandas, NumPy

* ### 🤖 Scikit-learn

* ### ⚡ XGBoost

* ### 📈 Matplotlib, Seaborn

* ### 🧪 MLflow (Experiment Tracking & Model Registry)

* ### 🌐 Streamlit (Web Application)

* ### 💾 Joblib (Model Serialization)

# **🧠 MLOps & Experiment Tracking**

### MLflow used for logging:

* ### Model parameters

* ### Performance metrics

* ### Artifacts and visualizations

### Best models registered and versioned for production use

# **🌐 Streamlit Application Features**

* ### Multi-page interactive dashboard

* ### Real-time EMI eligibility prediction

* ### EMI amount estimation

* ### Data exploration and visualization

* ### MLflow experiment monitoring integration

# **📊 Key Insights**

* ### Credit score and monthly income are strong predictors of EMI eligibility

* ### Expense patterns significantly influence EMI affordability

* ### Tree-based models (Random Forest & XGBoost) outperform linear models

# **🚀 Conclusion**

## EMIPredict AI demonstrates how machine learning and MLOps can transform traditional financial risk assessment into a scalable, automated, and intelligent system.
## It enables faster decision-making, reduces default risk, and enhances customer experience through data-driven insights.
